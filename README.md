# The MOSEF (Modular Synthesizer Framework)
MOSEF is a Java framework for building modular synthesizers. As with analog modular synthesizers, the output of any module in MOSEF can be used as input or modulating input for any other module, allowing for the creation of a wide range of synthesizers and effects.

The framework can be built using Maven. There is a [demo project](https://github.com/jonas-lj/MOSEF-demo) which contains some usage examples.
